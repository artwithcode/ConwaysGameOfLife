# Conway's Game of Life using Python3

*	A cellular automaton
*	Simply known as 'Life'
*	Devised by the British Mathermatician John Horton Conway
*	Its a 'zero player' game, it only needs the inital state 

The **Game of Life** is an two dimensional orthongonal grid of 'cells' 

*	Each cell has two states
	*	Dead
	*	Alive

**Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are**
 
*	horizontally
*	vertically
*	diagonally adjacent. 

**At each step in time, the following transitions occur,**

*	Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.

*	Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

*	Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

*	Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Dev Tools 

*	**Python3**
	Python is a high level, scripted programming language easy for beginners and newcomers alike. 

*	**Processing Library**
	Useful for drawing graphics on the screen, and has other useful functions to test simulations. It has a library called P5 ported for python! [Github Repo](https://github.com/p5py/p5)
